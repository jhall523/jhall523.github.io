Apparently mommy blogs are the new black, and it looks fabulous on everyone, especially new moms still sporting the tell-tale “mommy pooch.” So I’m dying to try it. Truth be told, I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for a while now. Not that I am super interesting, I’m not that talented or even photogenic (because every good blog has LOTS of photos). But I’m so inspired by many of my favorite mommy bloggers that have made me feel like I am part of the larger mom community. So I’m starting this blog to chronicle our lives and put in print those moments that I never want to forget, and I’m hoping that by doing so other first-time moms will read my words and feel a little less alone, something I struggled with as a first time mom without any other mom friends. That, and I hope it will be a good outlet for me because this past year my life turned completely upside down, (or as I like to think of it, right-side up), which has been overwhelmingly wonderful and amazing and terrifying and exhausting.  In just one short year, I graduated from school, landed my first real, big-girl, full-time job at an inpatient rehab facility, moved back home, bought a house, and became a mom. In essence, I became a full-fledged adult when at times I still feel like I’m 18 years old and trying to figure out this big world in which I live and my place in it.

I’m not a great decorator, chef, gardener, or crafter, and I’m not the typical stay-at-home-mom blogger. And to be completely honest, I am the last person to be giving advice about motherhood or raising a tiny human, because my own motherhood journey has been messy at best and frought with mistakes, depression, and anxiety. But I’ve learned more about myself in the last six months as a first time mom than I have in the last 29 years of my life. And I believe the growth and evolution occurring both as a person and as a mom, with my marriage, and with my ever-expanding family is worth sharing. 

Here you’ll find my efforts at becoming a better, more driven, and more focused version of myself than I was before I was ever blessed with the divine duty of motherhood. I’ll share with you all my thoughts, ramblings, adventures and misadventures of homeownership, partnership in marriage, and trials and tribulations as a mom. I’ll share with you the journey of Addy and our family as we try to navigate this new life of ours. You will get the good, the bad, the boring, and the ugly. So be kind and patient with me. I’m still learning.  

Oh, almost forgot – my first photo. Here’s my amazing family:
